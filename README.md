TwitchPlaysPokemon.me
=====================

A site that tracks stats of TPP's Pokemon Stadium 2 using OCR. 
This is my first project I'm trying out using a VCS, so there's going to be lots of extraneous commits to this project for testing purposes.

In short, I'm recording the TwitchPlaysPokemon stream of Pokemon Stadium 2, perform OCR to extract Pokemon-specific information such as status, current/total HP, and its movesets. These are standardized for the length of stream, so each pokemon is assumed to be persistent throughout the randomized selection process. 
This information will then be compared to a list of moves to gauge their effectiveness, and assign said pokemon a probability of winning. 
The goal of this project is to correctly predict match outcomes based on stats alone, in order to correctly place bets on said pokemon. 

I'll figure out a better description after I've got more code under my belt. Cheers!
